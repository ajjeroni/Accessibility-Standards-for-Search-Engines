## Description

In this project, students were given the task to modify a starter code to develop agile project management skills. This code took the form of a Mock-up web application with HTML and CSS properties. To successfully complete this task students needed to find semantic HTML elements, find that elements follow a logical structure, find accessible alt attributes, correct heading attributes in sequential order, and title elements concisely and descriptive.
